	abstract = {In daily human interactions, spatial reasoning occupies an important place. In this paper we present a situation assessment reasoner that generates relevant symbolic information from the geometry of the environment with respect to relations between objects and human capabilities. The role of {SPARK} ({SPAtial} Reasoning and Knowledge) component is to permanently maintain a state of the world in order to provide a basis for the robot to plan, to act, to react and to interact. More precisely, we describe here the way the system manages the hypotheses to be able to handle such knowledge in a flexible manner. Equipped with such capabilities, a robot that will interact with humans should be able to extract, compute or infer these relations and capabilities in order to communicate and interact efficiently in a natural way. To illustrate our work, we will explain how the robot is able to manage and update agents beliefs and pass Sally-Anne test. This work is part of a broader effort to develop a complete decisional framework for human-robot interactive task achievement.},

	title = {Towards adaptive semantic subscriptions for stream reasoning in the robot operating system},
	doi = {10.1109/IROS.2017.8206440},
	abstract = {Modern robotic systems often consist of a growing set of information-producing components that need to be appropriately connected for the system to function properly. This is commonly done manually or through relatively simple scripts by specifying explicitly which components to connect. However, this process is cumbersome and error-prone, does not scale well as more components are introduced, and lacks flexibility and robustness at run-time. This paper presents an algorithm for setting up and maintaining implicit subscriptions to information through its semantics rather than its source, which we call semantic subscriptions. The proposed algorithm automatically reconfigures the system when necessary in response to changes at run-time, making the semantic subscriptions adaptive to changing circumstances. To illustrate the effectiveness of adaptive semantic subscriptions, we present a case study with two SoftBank Robotics NAO robots for handling the cases when a component stops working and when new components, in this case a second robot, become available. The solution has been implemented as part of a stream reasoning framework integrated with the Robot Operating System (ROS).},
